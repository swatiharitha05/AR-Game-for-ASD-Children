# AR-Game-for-ASD-Children

## Project Overview
The current project aims to implement Augmented Reality (AR) in a web-based game, that assists the autism children to learn, read and speak effortlessly.

## Problem Statement
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex nuerological disorder, often observed in children and adolescents. Children with ASD often face challenges with pronunciation and phonics. We propose an AR-based game where they explore a themed environment to collect and assemble phonics of a word. Completing the word reveals a 3D object and provides audio feedback. This interactive approach creates an engaging, sensory-rich learning experience tailored to their needs.

## Existing System
Otsimo Special Education is an app specifically designed to teach life skills to children with autism. It consists of various games and interactive lessons like role-playing scenarios, emotion recognition games, and exercises to improve conversational skills that engage children and teach them how to interact with others and express themselves effectively.

## Proposed System
An innovative Augmented Reality (AR) game designed to improve pronunciation skills is proposed in this project. This web-based application is a puzzle game which contains various tiles, each representing a phonic, and the player must select right phonics in correct order to form a word. Upon correctly assembling the word, the game plays the correct pronunciation and displays a 3D AR model of the wordâ€™s meaning or object. The difficulty of the words gradually increases as the user progresses, so as to ensure user's vocabulary at different complexities.

## Technologies used
1) VSCODE
2) Blender
3) 3D Viewer
4) React Native
5) React Expo
6) Three JS
7) Javascript
8) Node JS
   
## Dataset
Dataset we have used for the development of this application is as follows:
1) Audio files of each syllable differentiated
2) .glb files of AR models
3) Background images of the app
   
## Results
The implementation of the project using immersive AR technology proved to be useful in engaging the user through its striking 3D visuals and animations. As the application is designed in a level-based manner, including incremental difficulty levels, this ensures the user's progress in learning and improving his/her vocabulary.

## Conclusion
An AR based web application game has been developed to assist the autism children in their learning journey, imbibing the visually appealing and interactive characteristics of AR technology to enhance user-experience and keep the user engaged, by displaying the corresponding 3D models of the words correctly assembled.

## How to Run
1) Download the expo go framework using the command:
   "npm install expo"
3) Make sure that the device having the dependency and the project code shares the same internet connection.
4) Open the project in VSCode and navigate to its terminal.
5) Run the project using the command: "npx expo start"
6) Click "W" to run the project as web application.
